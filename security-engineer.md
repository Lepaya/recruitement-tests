# Case Study Presentation for Security Engineers

In this test assignment we would like to ask you to create a small presentation and deliver it to us so we can understand your thought process and skills.

## Assignment overview:
Please, prepare a 20 minute presentation in which you give your answers to the following questions:

- Based on the job description and your experience, describe your role at Lepaya.
- What would be your plan for your first 3 to 6 months?
- What do you need from management and the rest of the company to be successful in your role?

## Deliverable and deadline:
We would like to suggest spending a maximum of 4-6h on the assignment. 

We do understand you don't have all the necessary information to properly address these questions, but use your experience to answer them the best you can. We are more interested in your way of thinking, experience and how you express your ideas than the answers themselves.

As soon as you are ready, reach out to our Talent Acquisition team to share your deck and schedule your presentation.
